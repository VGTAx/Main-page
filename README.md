# Main-page
Main-Page is a web application that allows users to register and log in to access certain features. The application is implemented based on <b>JavaScript, HTML and CSS</b> technologies, and uses <b>SOAP requests</b> to exchange data with the server.<br>

The application has two main functions - user registration and authorization. Both functions are implemented in the form of a modal window that appears on the main page when you click on the button.<br>

When you click on the "Register" button, a form opens in a modal window where the user can enter his data, such as first name, last name, phone number, email address and password. After filling in all the fields, the user can click on the "Register" button to send their data to the server using a SOAP request. Upon successful registration, the server sends a confirmation and the user is redirected to the authorization page. <br>

All user interface elements are designed using HTML and CSS. JavaScript is used to process events on the client side. To send SOAP requests to the server, the corresponding library is used. All data received from the server is displayed on the page using JavaScript.<br>
